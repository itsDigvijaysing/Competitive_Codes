# Codes

A collection of helpful and fun code snippets which i solved. This repository is meant for learning, experimentation, and enhancing programming skills across multiple languages.

## Learning is Fun

> "Failure makes you smarter."

Coding can be challenging, but every failure brings valuable lessons. This section contains fun and experimental code pieces for learning and enjoyment.

## Competitive Programming

I am actively writing solutions for coding challenges on LeetCode and Codeforces. You can find almost all my solutions here to get an idea of my approach and style.

## Kaggle

In my free time, I plan to work on Kaggle projects to further explore data science and machine learning. Stay tuned for updates on this journey!
